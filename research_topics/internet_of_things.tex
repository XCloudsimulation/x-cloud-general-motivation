\subsection{Influence of huge number of (mobile) devices and internet of things \emph{Ume√•} }
\subsubsection{Proposed research}
The number of devices accessing the cloud services is bound to grow significantly with the advent of the internet of things. Most of these devices will communicate over the mobile network. Although the added devices will not necessarily contribute as much data traffic as a user-interaction device, they will significantly add to the congestion to the radio access networks and the adjacent core network. In such a case the, the congestion might result in increased latency in the mobile access network and the adjacent core network.
