\subsection{How many devices can be handle by the current infrastructure (latency/bandwidth limits or other requirements) \emph{Ume√•} }
\subsubsection{Proposed research}
%The number of devices accessing the cloud services is bound to grow significantly with the advent of the internet of things. Most of these devices will communicate over the mobile network. Although the added devices will not necessarily contribute as much data traffic as a user-interaction device, they will significantly add to the congestion to the radio access networks and the adjacent core network. In such a case the, the congestion might result in increased latency in the mobile access network and the adjacent core network.
In our research we would like to simulate the current network infrastructure (mobile network, core network, remote/big data centers) and show the limits of it.
\begin{itemize}
\item What will happen when the number of connected devices increases by order(s) of magnitude? The influence on a core network (connection between a base station and a big/remote data center).
\item How many connected devices can be handeled by the current infrastructure (depending on a latency limits)?
\end{itemize}
