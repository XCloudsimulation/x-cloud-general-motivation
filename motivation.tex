The motivations for the adoption of the \xcloud are multidimensional. ...

The geographic distance separating the device and the host introduces a propagation delay. The intra-continental propagation delay is in order of 20-30 ms, which conceivably constitutes a concious geographic placement of the data centre to minimize the propagation delay, on the scale of hundreds of kilometres. ...

The number of devices accessing a service in a geographic area contributes to congestion on the access links. More and more devices will access the internet and so also cloud services the wireless medium. As a result, the access links will be suffer from an increasing level of congestion. ...

The forthcoming mobile networks are protectedly distributed with virtualized centralized resources. The scale of which is proportional to the acceptable distance between the antenna and the aggregated centralized resources. ...

All of the above factors provide just as many data centre placement possibilities. It is the purpose of our our research to ...
