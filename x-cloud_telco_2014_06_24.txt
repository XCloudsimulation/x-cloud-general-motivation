Meeting notes from telco 2014-06-24

1) Perspectives
	UmU - run/test/evaluate algorithms for resource management
	Ericsson - make decisions about structure of physical infrastructure
	LTH - similar to Ericsson
		- provision of mobile network and core network
		- type of infrastructure
		- run automatic control process applications over topology (Control Department)

2) Questions we would like to answer
	U - VM placement & migration decisions

	U/E - how many devices can be handle by the current infrastructure (latency/bandwidth limits or other requirements)

	U/E - influence of huge number of (mobile) devices and internet of things

	E - placement of edge data centres
		- max distance from antenna
		- min number of antennas per edge data centre
	
	E - size of edge data centres (#CPU, memory, etc)

	L - what type of traffic should be directed to edge data centres?

	L - topology of mobile network (antennas detached from BTS) CRAN

	L - how mobility of user affects network and cloud computing?

3) Hypothesis
	- Current infrastructure will not be able to handle the workload generated by billions (trillions) of mobile devices
	- Introduction of edge data centres will improve quality of service

4) Requirements
	
	Required models:
	- Data Center (DC)
	- Base Transceiver Station (BTS)
	- Core network (BTS - DC)
	- Mobile network
	- Mobile devices ?
	- User
		- workload generator
		- mobility
	- Service (application)
	- Demography ?

	How we will build it?
	- flexible
		- how to plug-in other simulators?
		- check existing simulation tools

	Required 
	- resource consumption
	- VM placement
	- VM migration
	- network congestion (latency, bandwidth)

	Additional suggestions:
	- Common API for deployment of VMs (eg. Amazon, Rackspace, Google)
	- easy to configure (not to many parameters)

5) What to present during Cloud Control Workshop in Molle?
	- abstract models of x-cloud
	- evaluation of existing simulation tools

6) TODO:
	- define granularity of each model
	- find what is irrelevant in the model?
