Placing capacity in the capillaries of the network does not necessarily have to be a means to reduce latency and congestion, but also a vessel within which localized services can be hosted. Localized services can exists purely in the \xcloud, serve only one user and geographically migrate with the user, be fully of partially hosted in the \xcloud. Different tiers can proposedly by hosted at distributed, depending on the users mobility behaviour. Conceivably, such services could range from compute offloading, game rendering, emergency services, sensor and traffic monitoring, low-latency process control, such as surgical robotics.
