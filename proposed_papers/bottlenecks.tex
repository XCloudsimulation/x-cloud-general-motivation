Simulate the current infrastructure (mobile network + remote/big data centers) and show the limits of it.

\begin{itemize}
\item What will happen when the number of mobile devices increases by order(s) of magnitude? The influence on a network connection between a base station and a big/remote data center.
\item How many mobile devices can be handeled by the current infrastructure (depending on a latency limits)?
\end{itemize}
