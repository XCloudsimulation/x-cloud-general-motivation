\subsubsection{The setup/structure of \xcloud}
The \xcloud consists of antennas, small (edge) data centers and big (remote) data centers.
Small data centers are located close to the antennas and can host both virtualized base station software and VMs with applications.
Big data centrs are located far away from users.
Small data centers have smaller amount of resources than big ones (maybe also performance is lower) and running applications there is more expensive.
However, latency is is much lower than in a case of big (remote) data centers.

Questions about the setup/structure of \xcloud:
\begin{itemize}
\item how many antennas should be associated with one small (local) data center? (probably this will be limited by the latency between an antenna and a small data center)
\item how big should small (local) data centers be (\#CPUs etc)?
\end{itemize}
