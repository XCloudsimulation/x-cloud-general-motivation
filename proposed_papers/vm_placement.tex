\subsection{Virtual Machine placement and migration in \xcloud}

Regarding placement of Virtual Machines (VMs) in the edge data centers:
\begin{itemize}
\item Should a VM that serves all users (even these outside of the range of the directly connected antennas) be placed in an edge data cener or should it be rather an additional instance that serves users that are in the close proximity (duplicating a VM in a big data center)?
\item When a VM should be placed/duplicated in a small data center?
\item While users are moving from one antenna to another when VM should be migrated from one edge data center to another one?
\end{itemize}
