Meeting notes from telco 2014-06-13

1) define the problem in more details
	- identify questions that we would like to answer
	- define hypothesis
	- motivations (eg. computation offloading)

2) compare existing simulation frameworks and describe their limitations
	- what we would like to model
		* latency
		* bandwidth
		* energy (computation offloading)
		* data centres
		* network
	- why we cannot model that with existing simulators

3) find event-driven simulation framework
	- suitable to plug-in other simulators (Modelica, Matlab, NS3, CloudSim, GreenCloud, ICanCloud)
	- plug-in algorithms: elasticity, admission control, etc.
	- possible candidates: SimJava, PySim

4) build modular event-driven simulator
	- to prove concepts
		* to verify test hypothesis (if x-cloud gives any benefit)
		* to test algorithms and applications
	- keep simulation general and abstract
		* no focus on any specific model (LTE etc.)
		* no hand overs, etc.
	- parts:
		* data centers
		* network
		* users mobility
